# Project Life Cycle

## 1. Initiation Phase
- Conduct stakeholder workshops (executive sponsor, product, coaches, support, marketing) to refine vision and KPIs.
- Define business case, success metrics (acquisition, retention, NPS), and secure funding.
- Establish governance model, steering committee cadence, and risk register.

## 2. Discovery & Analysis
- Elicit requirements for customer portal, coach/admin consoles, and integrations aligned with BRD/SRS/PRD.
- Map current vs. future state journeys, document process flows (BPMN), and finalize personas.
- Validate regulatory obligations (GDPR, PDPA) and data handling policies with compliance team.

## 3. Design Phase
- Create UX prototypes for customer onboarding, training dashboard, scheduling, community, and admin workflows.
- Define solution architecture, data models, API contracts, and integration patterns.
- Produce testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E, performance, accessibility, security).

## 4. Implementation Phase
- Execute Scrum sprints delivering prioritized backlog (see ProductBacklog.md) with CI/CD pipelines.
- Establish feature flag strategy and automated quality gates (lint, unit tests, security scans).
- Conduct sprint reviews with stakeholders and incorporate feedback into backlog refinement.

## 5. Verification Phase
- Perform comprehensive QA: functional, regression, integration, performance, security, and accessibility testing.
- Facilitate UAT sessions with representative customers, coaches, and admins to validate readiness.
- Ensure documentation (user guides, support playbooks) completed and approved.

## 6. Deployment Phase
- Run release readiness reviews, finalize go/no-go decisions per ReleasePlan.md.
- Execute blue/green deployment, monitor health checks, and communicate launch updates.
- Provide real-time support (hypercare) during initial rollout.

## 7. Operations & Continuous Improvement
- Monitor KPIs, capture feedback via in-app surveys/community forums, and prioritize enhancements.
- Schedule regular security/compliance audits and infrastructure maintenance.
- Iterate roadmap (AI, mobile apps, additional integrations) based on strategic goals and analytics insights.
